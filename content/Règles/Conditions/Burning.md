A burning creature or object takes **1d4** *Fire* damage at the start of each of its turns. 

As an action, you can extinguish fire on yourself by giving yourself the [[RÃ¨gles/Conditions/Prone]] condition and rolling on the ground. 

The fire also goes out if it is doused, submerged, or suffocated.
