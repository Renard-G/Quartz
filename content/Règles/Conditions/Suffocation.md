A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to **1** plus its **Constitution** modifier (minimum of 30 seconds) before suffocation begins. When a creature runs out of breath or is choking, it gains **1** [[Règles/Conditions/Épuisement\|Exhaustion]] level at the end of each of its turns. 

When a creature can breathe again, it removes all levels of Exhaustion it gained from suffocating.
