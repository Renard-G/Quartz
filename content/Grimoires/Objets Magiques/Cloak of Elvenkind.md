*Wondrous Item, uncommon (requires attunement)*

While you wear this cloak with its hood up, **Wisdom** *Perception* checks made to see you have *disadvantage*, and you have *advantage* on **Dexterity** *Stealth* checks made to hide, as the cloak's color shifts to camouflage you. 

Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
