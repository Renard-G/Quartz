*Arme enchantée, rare.*

![[Source/Emblèmes, Objets & Indices/Hache orc enchantée.png]]

**Hache de Gubrash, le Chasseur Orc.**  Cette hache permet de caster le sort [[Grimoires/Codex Arcanum/Hunter’s Mark]] sur une cible.

You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra **1d6** *Force* damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have *Advantage* on any **Wisdom** (*Perception* or *Survival*) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 Hit Points before this spell ends, you can take a *Bonus Action* to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.
