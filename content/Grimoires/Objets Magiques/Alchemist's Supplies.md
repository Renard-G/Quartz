Alchemist’s supplies enable a character to produce useful concoctions, such as acid or [[Alchemist’s Fire]].

**Components.** Alchemist’s supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.

**Arcana.** Proficiency with alchemist’s supplies allows you to unlock more information on *Arcana* checks involving potions and similar materials.

**Investigation.** When you inspect an area for clues, proficiency with Alchemist’s Supplies grants additional insight into any chemicals or other substances that might have been used in the area.

**Alchemical Crafting.** You can use this tool proficiency to create alchemical items. A character can spend money to collect raw materials, which weigh 1 pound for every **50** *gp* spent. As part of a long rest, you can use Alchemist’s Supplies to make one dose of acid, [[Alchemist’s Fire]], antitoxin, oil, perfume, or soap. Subtract half the value of the created item from the total *gp* worth of raw materials you are carrying.
