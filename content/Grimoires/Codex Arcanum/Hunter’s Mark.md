You magically mark one creature you can see within range as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra **1d6** *Force* damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack roll. You also have *Advantage* on any **Wisdom** (*Perception* or *Survival*) check you make to find it.

If the target drops to 0 Hit Points before this spell ends, you can take a *Bonus Action* to move the mark to a new creature you can see within range.

**Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot.** Your [[Concentration]] can last longer with a spell slot of level 3â€“4 (up to 8 hours) or 5+ (up to 24 hours).
