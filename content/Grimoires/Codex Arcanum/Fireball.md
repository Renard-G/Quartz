A bright streak flashes from you to a point you choose within range and then blossoms with a low roar into a fiery explosion. Each creature in a 20-foot-radius Sphere centered on that point makes a **Dexterity** *saving throw*, taking **8d6** *Fire* damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Flammable objects in the area that aren’t being worn or carried start burning.

**_Using a Higher-Level Spell Slot._** The damage increases by **1d6** for each spell slot level above 3.
