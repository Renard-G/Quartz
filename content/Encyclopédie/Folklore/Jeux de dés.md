#### 38's

 Everyone antes in, rolls a secret **d20**, then does a round of bets with raises, calls, and folds like poker. The next round, everyone rolls a secret **d12**, and repeat the betting. Last round, everyone rolls a secret **d6**, then a final round of betting before the reveal.  

A 38 beats everything (20, 12, and 6). A 3 beats everything else (1, 1, and 1). After that, highest number wins. A tie is either split or settled with some kind of blind roll.

#### Baldur's Bones

Popular dice game in taverns. Each player requires several six-sided dice. The rules are as follows:

- Each player puts the agreed ante in the pot

- Each player rolls three dice. Play then proceeds clockwise around the table, with the host of the game going last

- On their turn, a player can choose to "stand" or "roll." If the player stands, the next player can take a turn. A player who rolls takes an additional die and rolls it. If the total of their dice exceeds 21, they "bust" and are out of the game. Otherwise, they can keep rolling additional dice until they either stand or break

- After everyone has had a turn, the highest point total (excluding players who busted) wins the game and takes the pot

#### Chuck-a-luck

Un jeu de dé avec un croupier où chaque joueur peut parier un montant d’argent sur un chiffre, de **1** à **6**. Le croupier lance **3d6**. Si le numéro choisi apparaît deux fois, le parieur remporte deux fois sa mise.

#### Le Pèlerin
